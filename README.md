**Texture Locale Redirector** adds native multi-language texture support to Minecraft resource packs.  

By extending vanilla resource loading mechanism, this mod allows you to provide language-specific textures within a single resource pack.  
It solves the problem where localized textures (with text or symbols) for one language may negatively affect players in other languages.

## Usage

Follow these three simple steps to enable multi-language textures:

1. **Install the mod**: Place this mod in your `mods` folder.  
2. **Create a resource pack**: Organize your localized textures according to the required folder structure.  
3. **Start the game**: Enable the resource pack and switch to the corresponding language in Minecraft.  

## Resource Pack Structure Example

Inside your resource pack, store localized textures under `assets/<namespace>/textures/<language>/`.

- `<namespace>` is the namespace — `minecraft` for vanilla, or the modid for mods.  
- `<language>` is the language code, such as `zh_cn` (Simplified Chinese) or `ja_jp` (Japanese).  

**Note:** The relative path of the texture to be replaced must match the original texture path.

```
ResourcePackName/
└── assets/
    └── minecraft (namespace)/
        └── textures/
            ├── zh_cn/          # Simplified Chinese textures
            │   ├── block/
            │   │   └── dirt.png  # Replaced dirt texture
            │   └── item/
            │       └── diamond_sword.png  # Replaced diamond sword texture
            └── ja_jp/          # Japanese textures
                └── item/
                    └── diamond_sword.png  # Replaced diamond sword texture
```

## FTB Quests Support

This mod also provides optional support for [FTB Quests](https://github.com/FTBTeam/FTB-Quests).  
When FTB Quests is installed, images in the quest interface (`ChapterImage`) will
also switch to the corresponding localized textures based on the current language.

* Any images or icons used in quests can be replaced via resource packs.
* If no localized texture is found, it will fall back to the default texture.
* Implemented via a **Mixin plugin**, so this mod does not have a hard dependency on FTB Quests.

## Performance

This mod is heavily optimized and should have negligible performance impact:

* Works **only** when the current language is not `en_us`, meaning no effect for English players.  
* Implements an **advanced caching system** to drastically reduce unnecessary disk I/O.  
* Clears cache upon language change or resource reload, ensuring textures are updated immediately.  
* Automatically releases cache memory when system memory is low to prevent lag.  
* If a resource pack has no language-specific texture folder, no replacement scan is performed — avoiding unnecessary work.  
* Does not interfere with the normal operation of other resource packs.
